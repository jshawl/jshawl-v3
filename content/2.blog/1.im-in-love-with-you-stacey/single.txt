The obligatory 'Hello World' blog post

I heard about this cool CMS called [Stacey](http://staceyapp.com) today. It's a PHP based flat file content management system.

Using Stacey means:

* I can host the source of this site on github
	* there are no passwords/logins/admin screens.
	* Everyone can see how I write and structure code.
* I never have to leave the command line.
	* AWW YEAH!
* Content is separated _entirely_ from layout/markup

I haven't been this excited about since a piece of software since who knows when. 

Anyway, I've been hacking away on Wordpress sites for a little over a year now, and it's always such a hassle setting up the database (local _and_ remote) and getting some kind of development environment in place.

Not with Stacey!
