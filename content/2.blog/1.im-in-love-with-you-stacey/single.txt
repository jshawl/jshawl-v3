I heard about this cool CMS called Stacey today. It's a PHP based flat file content management system.

Using Stacey means:

* I can host the source of this site on github
	* there are no passwords/logins/admin screens.
	* Everyone can see how I write and structure code.
* I never have to leave the command line.
	* AWW YEAH!
* Content is separated _entirely_ from layout/markup
