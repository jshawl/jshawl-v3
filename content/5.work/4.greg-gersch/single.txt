Wordpress rocks! Greg will be able to edit the content as needed through a WYSIWYG editor.

Oh yes... and it's responsive!

With [fitvids.js](http://fitvidsjs.com/), I was able to drop in a simple embed code for YouTube videos and let the jQuery do all the magic regarding aspect ratio calculations.

Lastly, I've never worked with a two-column layout in a Wordpress environment before. I used [this plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multiple-content-blocks/), which just adds additional WYSIWYG windows in the admin interface.
