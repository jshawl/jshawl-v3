PHP, I love you very much.

We needed to build a site that was:

1. Responsive
2. Lightweight
3. Easily updated by the client

Naturally, I thought PHP would be the best solution. Adding images to the work portfolio is as simple as dropping an image into a directory on the FTP server.
I also got to play around with jQueryUI and draggable items in the context of a responsive design.
